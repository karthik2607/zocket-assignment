1.What is network?
https://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap1/chap1.htm
A network is a system of interconnected devices or entities that communicate and share resources. Networks enable the exchange of data, information, and services between devices, often over distances. Networks can vary in scale, type, and purpose.

Key Components of a Network:

Devices (Nodes):
Computers, servers, smartphones, printers, etc.
Any device capable of sending or receiving data.

Medium of Communication:
Wired (e.g., Ethernet cables, fiber optics)
Wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular networks)

Protocols:
Rules and conventions that govern communication, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.

Network Infrastructure:
Routers: Direct data between networks.
Switches: Connect devices within a network.
Modems: Connect networks to the internet

Network Topology and its types

Network Topology refers to the arrangement or layout of devices (nodes) and how they are connected in a network. It defines the structure of a network, both physically (actual connections) and logically (data flow paths).

Types of Network Topologies

1. Physical Topology
Focuses on the actual physical layout of cables, devices, and connections.

2. Logical Topology
Describes how data flows through the network, regardless of its physical layout.

Common Network Topologies

1. Bus Topology
Description: All devices are connected to a single central cable (bus).

Advantages:
Easy to set up and cost-effective.
Requires minimal cable length.

Disadvantages:
A single point of failure (the bus).
Limited scalability.
High network traffic leads to collisions.

Use Case: Small networks with limited devices.

Example: Early LAN implementations.

2. Star Topology
Description: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.

Advantages:
Easy to add/remove devices.
Fault isolation (if a device fails, others remain unaffected).
High performance.

Disadvantages:
Central hub is a single point of failure.
More cabling required compared to bus topology.

Use Case: Home and office networks.

Example: Modern Ethernet networks.

3. Ring Topology
Description: Devices are connected in a circular manner, and data travels in one or both directions.

Advantages:
Reduced chances of collisions (data moves in a defined direction).
Suitable for high-speed networks.

Disadvantages:
A failure in one node disrupts the entire network (unless a dual-ring or fault-tolerant mechanism is used).
Troubleshooting can be challenging.
Use Case: Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) and some WANs.

4. Mesh Topology
Description: Every device is connected to every other device, either fully or partially.

Advantages:
Highly reliable (multiple paths ensure redundancy).
Fault tolerance.

Disadvantages:
Expensive due to cabling and ports.
Complex to install and manage.

Use Case: Critical networks requiring high reliability, like military systems.

Types:

Full Mesh: All nodes are interconnected.
Partial Mesh: Some nodes are interconnected.

5. Tree Topology
Description: Combines characteristics of bus and star topologies, with devices connected in a hierarchical manner.

Advantages:
Scalable (branches can be added).
Fault isolation is easier than in a bus topology.

Disadvantages:
Higher cost and complexity than a simple star or bus topology.
A failure in the backbone can disrupt the entire network.
Use Case: Large organizations.

6. Hybrid Topology
Description: Combines two or more different types of topologies.

Advantages:
Flexible and scalable.
Optimized for specific requirements.

OSI MODEL OVERVIEW

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers. It helps in understanding how data flows through a network and facilitates the development of interoperable networking protocols and devices.

Why the OSI Model?
Standardization: Provides a universal language for network communication.
Modularity: Each layer handles a specific function, simplifying troubleshooting and development.
Interoperability: Ensures different hardware and software can work together.

The Seven Layers of the OSI Model
Each layer serves a unique purpose and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)
Function: Handles the transmission of raw binary data over a physical medium.
Key Responsibilities:
Electrical, mechanical, and physical connections.
Signal transmission (voltage levels, modulation).
Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi, hubs.

2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Function: Manages node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
Key Responsibilities:
Framing and addressing (MAC addresses).
Error detection and flow control.
Sub-layers:
MAC (Media Access Control): Controls access to the physical medium.
LLC (Logical Link Control): Manages error checking and frame synchronization.
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), switches.

3. Network Layer (Layer 3)
Function: Determines the best path for data and handles logical addressing.
Key Responsibilities:
Routing data packets between networks.
Logical addressing (IP addresses).
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), routers, ICMP.

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)
Function: Ensures reliable data transfer between devices.
Key Responsibilities:
Segmentation and reassembly.
Flow control and error recovery.
Protocols:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Unreliable, connectionless.
Examples: TCP, UDP, port numbers.

5. Session Layer (Layer 5)
Function: Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between devices.
Key Responsibilities:
Synchronization and dialog control.
Session recovery after interruptions.
Examples: NetBIOS, Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
Function: Ensures data is in a readable format for the application layer.
Key Responsibilities:
Data translation (e.g., from ASCII to binary).
Encryption, decryption, and compression.
Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG.

7. Application Layer (Layer 7)
Function: Provides end-user services and interfaces for applications.
Key Responsibilities:
Interfacing between user applications and the network.
Service advertisement and data exchange.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
Data Flow Through OSI Layers
Sender Side:
Data starts at the Application Layer and moves down through the layers, being encapsulated with headers and trailers at each step.
Receiver Side:
Data arrives at the Physical Layer and moves up through the layers, being decapsulated to extract the original information.
Comparison of OSI and TCP/IP Models
Feature	OSI Model	TCP/IP Model
Number of Layers	7	4
Layer Names	Application, Presentation, etc.	Application, Transport, etc.
Protocol Independence	General framework	Specific to TCP/IP stack

Advantages of the OSI Model

Clear Segmentation: Each layer has a specific function.
Troubleshooting: Problems can be isolated to specific layers.
Scalability: Easily adaptable to new technologies.
Disadvantages of the OSI Model
Complexity: Not directly implemented in real-world networking.
