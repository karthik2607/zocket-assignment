 * Completed the Advanced Software Engineering Job Simulation where I solved
   difficult technical projects for a variety of teams at Walmart.
 * Developed a novel version of a heap data structure in Java for Walmart’s
   shipping department, showcasing strong problem-solving and algorithmic
   skills.
 * Designed a UML class diagram for a data processor, considering different
   operating modes and database connections.
 * Created an entity relationship diagram to design a new database accounting
   for all requirements provided by Walmart’s pet department.



“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Walmart’s job simulation on Forage and it was
incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a
software engineering team there.
During the simulation I gained experience and expertise implementing a novel
version of a heap data structure, designing a UML class diagram for a data
processor and creating a database that met a diverse range of requirements. It
was fantastic to experience how working as a software engineer at Walmart
touches and supports various different teams like the shipping department and
the pet department.
Through this experience I validated that I really enjoy working on complex
data-related challenges and working on projects that have real-world impact at a
massive scale. I’d love to apply what I learned in a software engineering team
at Walmart.
